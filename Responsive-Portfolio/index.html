			<h3>About Me</h3>

			<p>
				My name is Earl Clarin, and I currently live in San Diego. I am currently a Sr. Data Analyst at a financial services company that offers PACE financing for any energy efficient upgrades for your home. My hobbies consist of; building PCâ€™s, watching sports (NBA/NFL/MLB/Soccer), anything related to coffee, and playing video games. I am greatly enjoying my time so far in the Coding Bootcamp, as web development technologies have always interested me. I would like to focus on back-end development, but so far thoroughly enjoyed front-end dev work. Additionally, I would like to learn more about database technologies as this relates to my current role. With the skills acquired from this course, this will enable me the opportunity to pivot my career path, and focus on development.
